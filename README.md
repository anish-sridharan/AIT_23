## Q-learning

To run a normal experiment and/or calculate the Q* matrix make sure line 2 of q_learning_main.py is set to 
~~~
  from q_learning_skeleton import *
~~~

To instead run the code for question 8, with optimistic initialization, change line 2 to

  from q_learning_skeleton_optimistic_initialization import *
